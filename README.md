# Globe
A Javascript implementation of a virtual globe
## History
This project was a final year disertation from May 1996. The web existed, but JS did not. Google Earth / Maps definitely did not.
It was a passion projectjust for the fun of it. Cut to 2023, and I decided to review the original source code (and binary file) to resurect the project.
